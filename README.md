## ⏱️ The Challenge
This entire full-stack project—including the Client, Server, and Deployment mechanics—was built in **less than 45 minutes** (well under the 1 hour limit).

## 📝 Project Details
This is a challenge to demonstrate rapid development speed.

*   **Status**: Prank / Speed Challenge
*   **Time to Build**: ~45 Minutes
*   **Scope**: Full Stack (Frontend + Backend + Deploy Prep)

## 🚧 Functionality & Limitations
*   **Most Buttons DO NOT Work**: The "Forgot Password", "Sign up", and social login buttons are purely decorative.
*   **Working Feature**: Only the **Email** and **Password** fields and the **Sign In** button function, specifically to demonstrate the "prank" mechanics (sending data to the server).

**Disclaimer**: This project is for educational and entertainment purposes only.
